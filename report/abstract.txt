Traditionally, search engines have focussed on ranking search results for a particular
query based on some relevance function computed for an "average" user who is representative of
a large population of related users. With the widespread use of social media and the development
of efficient and massive data collection systems, search engines are increasingly trying to optimize
their search results based on individual users tastes and preferences. Personalization of search
results has a lot of commercial utility to it and has thus been the focus of lot of studies recently.
Earlier studies have come up with methods to model user preferences based on topic probability distributions,
creating user profiles based on various personal user attributes and so on. But such approaches don't
lend themselves directly to data which has been hashed to preserve user's privacy because of the fact
that random projections don't preserve similarity between attribute values. In this paper we develop
a per-user probabilistic generative model for web-search personalization which works on hashed data.
We trained our model on a massive dataset of size 45 GB based on data from over 5 million users and
used the NDCG measure to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. We were able to produce
results that were better than the randomized baseline and the non-personalized baseline. We also
discuss various avenues to explore to further improve our simplistic model to further improve the personalization.
